<p><span>By now, it&#39;s safe to say that nobody sings like</span> <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/billie-eilish/251741"><span>Billie Eilish</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Even at a pin-drop volume, her voice hits you in the solar plexus — which means it amounts to the ultimate vehicle for her astonishingly raw confessions. </span></p>
<p><span>Better yet, she has a collaborator bonded by blood: </span><a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/finneas-oconnell/251939"><span>FINNEAS</span></a><span> is a mighty musician in his own right, and their adventurousness and trust is part of the reason Eilish has become one of the most revered superstars of her generation.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, you&#39;ve probably heard Eilish&#39;s name, or at least one of her songs, out in the ether. But do you want to know more about what makes Eilish a pop phenom? Look no further than this handy factsheet, which provides a springboard for the nine-time GRAMMY winner to be part of your musical life.</span></p>
<p><span>Without further ado, here are nine common questions about the &quot;Happier Than Ever&quot; singer — and, of course, the answers.</span></p>
<h2 id="what-is-billie-eilishs-real-name"><strong><span>What Is Billie Eilish&#39;s Real Name?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>You&#39;re looking at it… well, somewhat. Because Eilish&#39;s full name is actually Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O&#39;Connell — a mellifluous mouthful!</span></p>
<p><span>But when the Angeleno singer/songwriter stormed onto the music scene in the mid-2010s, she shortened it to the first and last name known the world over.</span></p>

        </style><div class="prose body-text "><h2 id="what-are-billie-eilishs-biggest-songs"><strong><span>What Are Billie Eilish&#39;s Biggest Songs?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Well, from a GRAMMYs perspective, her biggest songs are the following:<br><br>&quot;bad guy,&quot; which won GRAMMYs for Record Of The Year and Song of the Year at the 2020 GRAMMYs.</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;everything i wanted,&quot; which won a GRAMMY for Record Of The Year at the 2021 GRAMMYs.</span></p>
<p><span>The titular theme from the James Bond flick </span><em><span>No Time to Die</span></em><span>, which won a GRAMMY for Best Song Written For Visual Media at the 2021 GRAMMYs.</span></p>
<p>Another movie track — “What Was I Made For?,” from <em>Barbie The Album</em> — earned Eilish her second golden gramophone for Best Song Written For Visual Media at the 2024 GRAMMYs, where the poignant ballad also won Song Of The Year.</p>
<p><span>Is that the end of the story, though? Not at all — peep her Spotify numbers. As of press time, wwo songs have more than 2 billion streams each, with her Khalid collab &quot;lovely&quot; at 2.77 billion and &quot;Bad Guy&quot; at 2.5 billion. And four more are past the 1 billion mark on Spotify alone: &quot;when the party’s over&quot; (1.8), &quot;everything i wanted&quot; (1.6), &quot;ocean eyes&quot; (1.38), and &quot;Happier Than Ever&quot; (1.3).</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;bad guy&quot; might just take the cake, though. Along with winning two GRAMMYs and having billions of streams, it&#39;s the only track of Eilish&#39;s (so far) to be certified Diamond by the RIAA.</span></p>
<h2 id="who-is-billie-eilishs-brother"><strong><span>Who Is Billie Eilish&#39;s Brother?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Why, none other than FINNEAS, who has worked with her throughout her career and become her inseparable creative facilitator. Basically, whenever you hear an Eilish song, you&#39;re hearing her 10-time GRAMMY-winning brother, too. (He has one more golden gramophone than Eilish because he won a GRAMMY for Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical in 2020.)</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;There&#39;s a lot of bulls—t articles about me now, about how I&#39;m not just Billie Eilish&#39;s brother. Just being Billie Eilish&#39;s brother is all I ever wanna be,&quot; FINNEAS </span><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/billie-eilish-finneas-quotes-about-each-other-will-make-you-want-to-be-a-better-sibling-22630133"><span>once declared</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>&quot;I love Billie more than anything else,&quot; he continued, &quot;and I&#39;m so grateful to you and I love you.&quot;</span></p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-billie-eilish-documentary"><strong><span>What Is The Billie Eilish Documentary?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>That would be the AppleTV+ documentary from 2021,</span> <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq?itscg=MC_20000&amp;itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&amp;mttnagencyid=a5e&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019876_1-500847015575-c&amp;mttnsubkw=113133209417__P9znFLw2_&amp;mttnsubplmnt="><span>Billie Eilish: The World&#39;s A Little Blurry</span></a><span>,</span></em><span> which details her rise to fame and unveils </span>the creative process of her debut studio album, 2019&#39;s <em>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</em><span> </span></p>

<p><span>To date, Eilish has won nine GRAMMYs and received 25 GRAMMY nominations.

<p>She sure has — two, in fact. In 2022, her and FINNEAS&#39; GRAMMY-winning theme for the 2021 James Bond flick <em>No Time to Die</em> won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. At the 2024 Oscars, they struck Oscar gold again with their <em>Barbie</em> hit &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="is-billie-eilish-involved-with-the-fashion--lifestyle-industries"><strong><span>Is Billie Eilish Involved With The Fashion &amp; Lifestyle Industries?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Absolutely — she&#39;s appeared at the Met Gala,</span> <a href="https://billieeilishfragrances.com/"><span>released her own fragrance</span></a>, <span>and made her mark with her variety of visual aesthetics, from high-end, oversized couture to a now-iconic green-and-black ombre hairdo.</span></p>
<h2 id="does-billie-eilish-have-a-new-album-coming"><strong><span>Does Billie Eilish Have A New Album Coming?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Yes! Her third studio album, </span><em><a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/billie-eilish-new-album-hit-me-hard-and-soft-review-takeaways"><span>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</span></a></em><span>, was released May 17. Though no singles were released before the album dropped (&quot;</span>i wanna give it to you all at once,&quot; she wrote in her <a target='_blank'  href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5gTZU-rWIJ/?hl=en">Instagram announcement</a> on April 8), the 10-song track list was revealed, and a snippet of the track &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; was featured in a teaser for the third season of the Netflix series &quot;Heartstopper.&quot;</p>
<p><span>However Eilish goes on to touch culture in a multitude of ways, it&#39;ll always come back to the music. Judging by how things have gone so far, she&#39;ll always have a legion of loyal fans eagerly waiting to see what she does next — whether with her music or beyond.</span></p>

But he credits most of that to good fortune.</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;I&#39;ve had such a lucky career trajectory — I have more success than I ever thought I would,&quot; he tells GRAMMY.com over a phone call. </span></p>
<p><span>But one doesn&#39;t get this far without true skill. The singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer has gained momentous success and has a unique ability to shape emotions into sound, whether he&#39;s scoring a new film or working with high-profile artists — mainly his sister, pop superstar </span><a href="https://grammy.com/artists/billie-eilish/251741"><span>Billie Eilish</span></a><span>. Honing in on these experiences has helped FINNEAS expand as an artist in his own right, as he turns to collaboration of his own on his sophomore solo album, </span><em><span>For Cryin&#39; Out Loud!</span></em><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Coming three years after his 2021 debut album, </span><em><span>Optimist</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>For Cryin&#39; Out Loud!</span></em><span> is a creative departure from his previous project. While the former was produced and written by FINNEAS himself, he worked with close friends to elevate his second record — and as a result, he sounds more confident than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span>The album features an adventurous sonic landscape, with funky guitar riffs, boisterous horns and infectious melodies across its 10 tracks. The bolder sound matches his assured vocal delivery, making</span> <em><span>For Cryin&#39; Out Loud!</span></em> <span>feel like the product of everything he has learned — and been working towards — since he was a teen.</span></p>

        </style><div class="prose body-text "><p><span>Born and raised in Los Angeles, the 27-year-old grew up around creativity. Raised by actor-musician parents, FINNEAS was immersed in the industry from a young age. Though his interest in songwriting was prompted by a class he took with his mom at age 12, he suggests that his production skills came naturally. From the beginning, his mantra has been simple: &quot;There&#39;s no right or wrong way to produce a song,&quot; he asserts. &quot;If there&#39;s any reason for people to pay attention, it&#39;s for being yourself and sharing your unique viewpoint.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>As he honed his perspective, FINNEAS served as the lead singer and songwriter for his high school alt-rock band, the Slightlys. And while he jokes that they &quot;begged people to come listen to us,&quot; the group offered FINNEAS his first taste of success: Along with winning several local Battle of the Bands competitions, they even earned a performance slot at Warped Tour in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span>The most fortuitous thing about the Slightlys, though, ended up being a song they never released — but FINNEAS&#39; then-unknown sister Billie did. After he penned a minimalist pop song called &quot;Ocean Eyes&quot; for the band, he decided it would be a better fit for Billie&#39;s voice. Little did either of them know, it would be the beginning of a fruitful — and wildly successful — partnership.</span></p>
<p><span>The song instantly gained traction on SoundCloud, prompting FINNEAS to start using his songwriting and production power to fuel Eilish&#39;s career. Along with being the sole producer for Eilish&#39;s debut EP, 2017&#39;s</span> <em><span>dont smile at me</span></em><span>, he served as her sole co-writer on all eight tracks, a formula that has continued to prove successful for Eilish&#39;s entire career thus far. But as things were booming for Billie, FINNEAS was simultaneously crafting his own breadth of work.</span></p>

        </style><div class="prose body-text "><p><span>In 2016, FINNEAS began his solo venture by releasing a string of romantic indie-pop songs. His debut single, the lustful &quot;New Girl,&quot; features bluesy instrumentals and seductive vocals; 2017&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m In Love Without You&quot; offered a more electro-pop-infused sound. As he continued to find his own musical identity, it quickly became clear that his early music would lean into the more bare-bones side of his creativity: breathy vocals, lush strings and rich piano chords.</span></p>
<p><span>The next year proved to be pivotal for FINNEAS, both as Eilish&#39;s collaborator and as an artist in his own right. As Eilish&#39;s career continued to rapidly rise thanks to &quot;you should see me in a crown&quot; and &quot;when the party&#39;s over&quot; — the latter of which was penned by FINNEAS himself — he also released eight tracks of his own, two of his biggest songs to date, &quot;Break My Heart Again&quot; and &quot;Let&#39;s Fall in Love for the Night.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>But it was 2019 that solidified FINNEAS as a force to be reckoned with. Along with co-producing and co-writing all of Eilish&#39;s debut album, </span><em><span>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</span></em><span>, he also released his debut EP, </span><em><span>Blood Harmony</span></em><span>, and scored hits as a songwriter/producer for the likes of </span><a href="https://grammy.com/artists/Selena-Gomez/38106"><span>Selena Gomez</span></a><span> (&quot;Lose You To Love Me&quot;), </span><a href="https://grammy.com/artists/jp-saxe/287491"><span>JP Saxe</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://grammy.com/artists/julia-michaels/188121"><span>Julia Michaels</span></a><span> (&quot;If The World Was Ending&quot;), and </span><a href="https://grammy.com/videos/ashe-lives-coffee-herbal-teas-white-sofas"><span>Ashe</span></a><span> (&quot;Moral of the Story&quot;). From the hyper-modern beats of Eilish&#39;s album, to the tender balladry of his co-written smashes, to the experimental sounds on his own project, FINNEAS demonstrated that there&#39;s no style that he can&#39;t master — and in 2020, his talents were rewarded in major fashion. </span></p>
<p><span>FINNEAS took home six GRAMMYs at the 2020 ceremony, mostly thanks to his work on</span> <em><span>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</span></em> <span>Perhaps the most significant win, though, was his award for Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical, which made him the youngest recipient of the honor at just 22 years old.</span></p>

        </style><div class="prose body-text "><p><span>As he continued creating with Eilish and expanding his superstar collaborator list — including</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/artists/justin-bieber/10220"><span>Justin Bieber</span></a><span>,</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/artists/halsey/19756"><span>Halsey</span></a> <span>and</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/artists/demi-lovato/19851"><span>Demi Lovato</span></a> <span>— he also carried on crafting his own music. Just months he celebrated another release with Eilish, 2021&#39;s</span> <em><span>Happier Than Ever</span></em><span>, FINNEAS unveiled his debut album,</span> <em><span>Optimist</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The project doubled down on the modern-sounding aesthetic of </span><em><span>Blood Harmony</span></em><span>, presenting an effortless adult contemporary spin on the sound he crafted with Eilish — but keeping the lyrical moody extremities. In contrast to its name, </span><em><span>Optimist</span></em><span> was brooding and edgy, accompanied by thoughts of grief, existentialism and the warped lens of fame; it was likely a product of his isolated creation process, as he wrote and produced all 13 tracks solo.</span></p>
<p><span>While FINNEAS was proud of his debut, he says that the album&#39;s creation was &quot;a fairly lonely process.&quot; And, even despite all of his achievements with Eilish and other stars, &quot;I didn&#39;t necessarily have the self-confidence to bring people in.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>With that in mind, he pushed his creativity and collaborative efforts further in 2022 and 2023. He wrote and composed music for films — most notably, Pixar&#39;s</span> <em><span>Turning Red</span></em> <span>in 2022 and a</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/news/2024-grammys-billie-eilish-wins-song-of-the-year-what-was-i-made-for-barbie"><span>GRAMMY-winning track</span></a> <span>for Greta Gerwig&#39;s</span> <em><span>Barbie</span></em> <span>in 2023, both alongside Eilish — and worked with</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/news/tate-mcrae-greedy-think-later-tour-big-year-interview"><span>Tate McRae</span></a> <span>(&quot;I Still Say Goodnight&quot;) and</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/artists/nicki-minaj/4579"><span>Nicki Minaj</span></a> <span>(&quot;Are You Gone Already&quot;). After wrapping production on Eilish&#39;s third album,</span> <em><span>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</span></em><span>,at the end of 2023, he went back to his solo work — but this time, not so solo. &quot;The main goal in this [next project] was, how can I make this a more exciting, fun experience for myself?,&quot; he says.</span></p>

        </style><div class="prose body-text "><p>To create <em>For Cryin&#39; Out Loud!</em>, FINNEAS invited a close group of peers to record live studio sessions, including Aron Forbes, Ricky Gourmet, Lucy Healey, and Miles Morris of the rock band Bad Suns. Almost completely opposite of Optimist, of the 10 tracks on <em>For Cryin&#39; Out Loud!</em>, only one is solely composed and written by FINNEAS (opener &quot;Starf—er&quot;).</p>
<p><span>In turn, </span><em><span>For Cryin&#39; Out Loud!</span></em> <span>features a much bigger soundscape than his previous work. Songs like &quot;Cleats&quot; and &quot;Lotus Eater&quot; feature hazy synths and strong drums that make room for hypnotic humming and chantable choruses. Yet, he didn&#39;t entirely move away from his more downtempo beginnings; &quot;Little Window&quot; and &quot;Same Old Story,&quot; offer intimate sounds across the album&#39;s largely anthemic feel.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the album&#39;s most poignant tracks is &quot;Family Feud,&quot; which calls back to the themes of </span><em><span>Optimist</span></em><span> — but this time, it&#39;s a tribute to his sister. Over soft strings, he croons about the pair&#39;s close bond and Eilish&#39;s struggles with fame: &quot;And you&#39;re only 22/ And the world is watching you/ Judging everything you do.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span>Even in the album&#39;s more somber moments</span><em><span>,</span></em> <span>FINNEAS exudes a new level of self-confidence on </span><em><span>For Cryin&#39; Out Loud!</span></em><span>. And he&#39;s eager to show that to fans around the world: FINNEAS will perform three intimate U.S. shows in October, and already has international dates set for the top of 2025. As for where he&#39;ll go from here with his solo work, time will tell — but it certainly seems like he&#39;s no longer limiting himself to solo sessions: &quot;I&#39;ve written a better album by breaking my own set of rules.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span>The unofficially coined cultural craze has seen a number of queer women sing openly and explicitly about their same-sex relationships. And they&#39;re not holding back: &quot;She was a Playboy, Brigitte Bardot/ She showed me things I didn&#39;t know,&quot; swoons Roan in &quot;Red Wine Supernova,&quot; while Eilish gushes &quot;she dances on my tongue&quot; in &quot;Lunch,&quot; and FLETCHER confesses in &quot;girls, girls, girls&quot; that she &quot;kissed a girl and…really, really liked it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>This era of openly sapphic joy follows a history of hardships, with decades of queer artists defying prejudice and homophobia to sing openly about their desires and emotions. It&#39;s not been an easy journey — and struggles are still painfully evident. When grilled about her sexuality last year, Eilish</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0abAXNxnpV/?img_index=1"><span>declared on Instagram,</span></a> <span>&quot;I like boys and girls leave me alone about it&quot;; it echoed</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/artists/dusty-springfield/6237"><span>Dusty Springfield</span></a><span>&#39;s 1970s</span> <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S2MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=dusty+springfield+bent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0nNbw4uKHAxVfQ0EAHWraJQ4QuwV6BAgEEAY#v=onepage&amp;q=dusty%20springfield%20bent&amp;f=false"><span>interview when she revealed</span></a><span>, &quot;I&#39;m perfectly capable of being swayed by a girl as by a boy... and I don&#39;t see why I shouldn&#39;t.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>Some have defined sapphic pop as a subgenre of indie or bedroom pop, and others have celebrated the more anthemic, upbeat &quot;sapphic bops.&quot; But in reality, no one style of music encapsulates lesbian/sapphic songs; these artists are united by loving and desiring other women — some openly, while others were restrained due to societal pressures.</span></p>
<p><span>The current wave of unapologetic queer stars marks a pivotal moment in music history, where sapphic pop is no longer cornered in lesbian circles and gay clubs, but dominating mainstream airwaves, and influencing global pop trends while being rightfully celebrated by the masses. So as the current queer female stars continue to thrive, it&#39;s important to pay homage to all of the artists that paved the way.</span></p>
<p><span>Read on for a history of defiantly queer women and nonbinary people in music — a celebration of who they are, how they have loved and their remarkable musical imprint.</span></p>

<p><span>Rising to fame in the 1960s with her blonde beehive and dark eye makeup, Springfield frequented London gay clubs at the height of the Swinging Sixties (which, ironically, didn’t have anything to do with queerness). With hits including &quot;You Don&#39;t Have To Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Son of a Preacher Man,&quot; her powerful voice channeled emotion with unnerving vulnerability.

Women artists were showing they were more than pop glam, picking up guitars and refusing to dress up for the cameras, favoring casual attire; sapphic pop was entering an era of authenticity and emotional honesty. Along the way, a group of feminist lesbians set up Olivia Records.</span></p>

British-Canadian singer Carole Pope was part of the rock band Rough Trade, characteristically clad in leather and singing raunchy songs dedicated to the joys of BDSM and girl-on-girl eroticism. Rough Trade&#39;s lustful 1980 song &quot;High School Confidential&quot; shocked listeners at the time: &quot;It makes me cream my jeans when she comes my way,&quot; swoons Pope. In 1981, she had a brief (but intense) relationship with Dusty Springfield.</span></p>
<p><span>A new folk movement was quietly brewing in the hushed tones and poignant strums of</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/artists/tracy-chapman/878"><span>Tracy Chapman</span></a><span>. Though she has never spoken publicly about her sexuality, her GRAMMY-winning hit &quot;Fast Car&quot; has been embraced as a lesbian anthem for its ideals of escapism and unhinged freedom. (Chapman&#39;s sexuality was later confirmed by her former lover, author Alice Walker, who</span> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/15/gender.world"><span>spoke about their mid-90s relationship</span></a> <span>in 2006, though there&#39;s no disclosed relation to &quot;Fast Car.&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span>Folk-rock duo</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/artists/indigo-girls/13019"><span>Indigo Girls</span></a><span>, who are both openly lesbian, formed in 1985 and immediately cultivated a cult queer following that led to a major label deal in 1988. Their 1989 self-titled album — which spawned the celebrated queer anthem &quot;Closer to Fine&quot; — went double platinum in the U.S. and won a GRAMMY for Best Contemporary Folk Recording in 1990. Just this year, the duo released a documentary,</span> <em><span>It&#39;s Only Life After All</span></em><span>, which charts their journey, revealing the homophobic snubs they&#39;ve stoically endured throughout their career.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, South AfricanBrenda Fassie began making music with her band the Big Dudes in the early 1980s, combining pop with hip-hop and kwaito. While Fassie did not explicitly sing about being queer, she often referred to herself as a lesbian and never hid her relationships with women. A staunch anti-apartheid campaigner, Fassie made pop with powerful social commentary; she was even hailed as the &quot;Madonna of the Townships&quot; for her brazen lyrics. Thought to be Africa&#39;s first openly queer pop star, Fassie remains a beacon of acceptance and tolerance in a region where homophobia is still rife — even two decades after her passing.</span></p>

        </style><div class="prose body-text "><p><span>Though we&#39;re only four years into the 2020s, the decade has been marked by an explosion of sapphic pop. New Jersey pop star FLETCHER helped kick off the movement in 2020 with her EP</span> <em><span>The S(ex) Tapes</span></em><span>, which navigated the end of a lesbian relationship through dark pop hooks loaded with sensual energy. Two years later, she doubled down on the lesbian narrative with her debut album,</span> <em><span>Girl Of My Dreams</span></em><span>, which spawned one of the most viral queer songs of the decade this far, &quot;Becky&#39;s So Hot.&quot; (In between, she delivered another lesbian bop alongside Kiyoko with 2021&#39;s &quot;Cherry.&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span>Norwegian indie star girl in red, who is openly queer, cultivated a huge online following after the release of standalone early singles (in the track &quot;i wanna be your girlfriend,&quot; she sings, &quot;Oh Hannah… I don&#39;t wanna be your friend/ I wanna kiss your lips&quot;), before releasing her highly anticipated debut</span> <em><span>if i could make it go quiet</span></em> <span>in 2021, featuring songs like &quot;Did You Come?&quot; (&quot;Did you do the things you know I like? Roll your tongue, make her cum 20 times?&quot;). Her connection to lesbians and bisexual women was so strong that the term &quot;do you listen to girl in red?&quot; evolved into a code to identify fellow queers on</span> <a href="https://www.them.us/story/girl-in-red-tiktok-gen-z-sexuality-identity"><span>Sapphic TikTok</span></a><span>.<br><br>In the Latin urban scene, openly gay Puerto Rican star</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/news/8-latinx-rappers-to-know-videos"><span>Young Mikko</span></a> <span>is shaking up reggaeton with her assured flow and cheeky, suggestive singles including &quot;Peach&quot; — an ode to her lover&#39;s rounded butt. Brazilian star Ludmilla makes listeners blush with her sensual track &quot;Sintomas de Prazer,&quot; talking about getting turned on while giving her lover pleasure. <br><br>After Billie Eilish established herself as one of the biggest pop stars of her generation, she faced intense pressure to come out as queer in November 2023. Six months later, her sexuality became a central theme in her third album,</span> <em><span>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</span></em> <span>— particularly the album&#39;s first single, &quot;LUNCH,&quot; a fearless ride on pleasuring women. She seems to be enjoying her newfound freedom, too: in her recent remix of Charli XCX&#39;s &quot;Guess,&quot; she deviously sings, &quot;I wanna … kiss it bite it, can I fit it?/ Charli likes boys, but she knows I&#39;d hit it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>Eilish was one of many Coachella 2024 performers who brought sapphic pop to the desert. Reneé Rapp&#39;s set was introduced by the cast of &quot;The L Word,&quot;</span> <a href="https://grammy.com/news/brazilian-women-singers-female-artists-anitta-marina-sena-duda-beat-liniker-ludmilla-iza-luedji-luna-portuguese-music"><span>Ludmilla</span></a><span>&#39;s shared a tender onstage kiss with her wife during love song &quot;Maldivas&quot;, and of course, Chappell Roan — decked in her Eat Me tee — had thousands to sing along with her unabashedly kinky hits.</span></p>
<p><span>Roan herself is redefining pop, with outfits inspired by drag aesthetic and lyrics that are unapologetically sapphic (&quot;Knee deep in the passenger&#39;s seat and you&#39;re eating me out/ Are we casual now?&quot; she sings in country pop ballad &quot;Casual&quot;). In August, Roan broke records for</span> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2024-08-07/lollapalooza-chappell-roan-performance-breaks-festival-record"><span>attracting Lollapalooza&#39;s largest-ever crowd</span></a><span>, and her rapidly rising fame helped her 2023 album,</span> <em><span>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</span></em><span>, reach No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200 (and a UK No. 1) nearly a year after its release.</span></p>
<p><span>Lesbian and queer artists have been making music for decades — and with artists more openly celebrating their sexuality than ever before, it&#39;s an undeniably exciting and historic time for the LGBTQIA+ music community. A new era of sapphic pop is upon us, and it&#39;s hot, explicit and gleefully unrestrained. You could even call it a femininomenon.</span></p>

<p><span>In July, singer/songwriter and four-time GRAMMY nominee </span><a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/jewel/13656"><span>Jewel</span></a><span> will embark on her first major tour in several years, alongside GRAMMY winner </span><a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/melissa-etheridge/12402"><span>Melissa Etheridge</span></a><span>. During the planning stage for the 28-city tour, Jewel suggested an idea that could reduce the tour’s carbon footprint.</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;I always thought it was so silly and so wasteful — and so carbon footprint-negative — to have separate trucks, separate lighting, separate crews, separate hotel rooms, separate costs,&quot; Jewel says. She pitched the idea of sharing a backing band with Etheridge. &quot;I’ve been trying to do this for 25 years,&quot; Jewel says with a laugh. &quot;Melissa is the first person who took me up on it!</span><span>&quot;</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The changes will not only reduce the tour’s carbon footprint, but they’ll also lessen the cost of taking the shows on the road. Acknowledging that there are many opportunities to meet the challenges of touring’s negative impact upon the environment, Jewel emphasizes that “you have to find [solutions] that work for you.”</span></p>

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">Adam Gardner believes that musicians are uniquely positioned to help make a difference where issues of sustainability are concerned. &quot;When you’re a musician, you’re connecting with fans heart-to-heart.

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">Small-scale, individual changes can make a difference — especially when they’re coordinated and amplified among other concertgoers. Gardner provides real-world examples. &quot;Instead of buying a plastic bottle, I brought my reusable and filled it up. Maybe I carpooled to the show.&quot; Conceding that such steps might seem like drops of water in a giant pool, he emphasizes the power of scale. &quot;When you actually multiply [those things for] just one summer tour, it adds up,&quot; he says. &quot;And it reminds people, ‘You’re not alone in this;</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2Themed SCXW156461422 BCX4">you’re</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">part of a community that’s taking action.&quot; </span><span class="EOP SCXW156461422 BCX4"> </span></p>

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">Watt acknowledges that like every concertgoer, each touring artist has a certain level of responsibility where sustainability is concerned.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun AdvancedProofingIssueV2Themed SCXW156461422 BCX4">&quot;And everyone can be doing something,&quot; he says, noting a number of straightforward actions that artists can put in place while on tour.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">&quot;They can eliminate single-use waste. They can donate hotel toiletries that [would otherwise] hit the landfill.&quot; </span><span class="EOP SCXW156461422 BCX4"> </span></p>
<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">Watt stresses that artists can lead by example. &quot;Nobody wants to listen to an artist telling them what to do if they’re not doing it themselves,&quot; he says. &quot;But we believe that everybody cares about something.&quot; He suggests that if an artist has cultivated a following, &quot;Why not use [that platform] to be that change you want to see in the world?&quot; </span><span class="EOP SCXW156461422 BCX4"> </span></p>
<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">Each artist has his or her own specific areas of concern, but Watt says that there’s a base level of &quot;greening&quot; that takes place on every REVERB-affiliated tour. Where things go from there is up to the artist, in coordination with REVERB. Watt mentions Billie Eilish and her tour’s sustainability commitment. &quot;The Venn diagram of food security, community health, access to healthy food, and the impact on the planet is a big cause for her,&quot; he says. &quot;</span><span class="NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2Themed SCXW156461422 BCX4">So</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW156461422 BCX4">there’s plant-based catering for her entire crew, across the entire tour.&quot;</span><span class="EOP SCXW156461422 BCX4"> </span></p>

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">Watt acknowledges that with so many challenges, it’s important for a concerned artist to focus on the issues that move them the most, and where they can make the biggest difference. &quot;</span><a href="https://grammy.com/artists/jack-johnson/3741"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">Jack Johnson</span></a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2Themed SCXW228124019 BCX4">is</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">a great example,&quot; he says. While Johnson is a vocal advocate for many environmental issues, on tour he focuses on two (in Watt’s words) &quot;cause umbrellas&quot;: single-use plastics solutions and sustainable community food systems. Each show on the tour hosts tables representing local nonprofit organizations, presenting concertgoers with real-world, human-scale solutions to those specific challenges. </span><span class="EOP SCXW228124019 BCX4"> </span></p>

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">After listing several other specific ways that her tour supports sustainability, Howard notes, &quot;By supporting these efforts, I am helping ensure future generations have access to clean water, fish, and all that I love about the outdoors.&quot; A dollar from every ticket sold to a Brittany Howard concert goes toward support of REVERB’s Music Decarbonization project. &quot;I’m also excited to see industry-wide efforts that are reducing the carbon pollution of live music,&quot; Howard continues. &quot;Because it’s not just [about] a single tour, it’s</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">every</span></em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">tour.&quot;</span><span class="EOP SCXW228124019 BCX4"> </span></p>

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">Watt is clear-eyed at the challenges that remain. &quot;Even the word ‘sustainable’ can be misleading,&quot; he concedes, suggesting that the only truly sustainable tour is the one that doesn’t happen. &quot;But if folks don’t step it up and change the way we do business in every industry — not just ours — we’re going to get to a place where we’re forced to make sacrifices that</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">aren’t</span></em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">painless.&quot; Getting that message across is REVERB’s aim. &quot;We can’t stop the world,&quot; Watt says. &quot;</span><span class="NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2Themed SCXW228124019 BCX4">So</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">we find ways to approach these things positively.&quot; </span><span class="EOP SCXW228124019 BCX4"> </span></p>

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">&quot;I’ve spent years traveling around the world, seeing the direct impact of climate change,&quot; Met says. He cites two recent and stark examples. &quot;When we pulled up to a venue in San Francisco, the band had to wear gas masks going from the bus into the venue, because of forest fires,&quot; he says. AJR’s road crew had to contend with a flash flood in Athens, Greece that washed out their hotel. &quot;And in Rome, some of our crew members fainted because of the heat.&quot; </span><span class="EOP SCXW228124019 BCX4"> </span></p>
<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW228124019 BCX4">Encouraged by representatives from the United Nations, Met launched Planet Reimagined. Met’s approach focuses on tailored, city-specific actions to empower fans and amplify diverse voices in the climate movement. Through social media and live shows, Met strives to galvanize climate activism among AJR fans. And the methods he has developed can be implemented by other touring artists. </span><span class="EOP SCXW228124019 BCX4"> </span></p>

And that’s something over which the artist has little or no control. What they can do, he says, is</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2Themed SCXW40071091 BCX4">try</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW40071091 BCX4">to educate and influence.

<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW40071091 BCX4">Polling a quarter million concertgoers across musical genres, the study collected data on attitudes about climate change. &quot;Seventy-three percent of fans who attend concerts believe that climate change is real, and that we need to be doing more about it,&quot; Met says. &quot;Seventy-eight percent have already taken some sort of action in their lives.&quot; He believes that if his organization can activate even a fraction of the estimated 250 million people annually who attend concerts around the globe, &quot;that’s the ballgame.&quot; </span><span class="EOP SCXW40071091 BCX4"> </span></p>

Eilish has two additional sold-out gigs at the Forum on Dec. 15 and 16. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eWhile there were no opening acts, just a pre-show soundtrack of classic Christmas tunes. Over the course of two hours, the 20-year-old ran through more than 30 songs on a stage that seemed to be fully constructed from LED screens. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eShe was not shy about displaying her youthful vigor, jumping in the air, doing the splits, jaunting around with the mic stand like a classic '70s rocker. Even while sitting on the floor during slow songs or confined to a small platform atop a crane as she floated around the arena, Eilish maintained her stage presence to the point that no one could take their eyes off her.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eOpening night of the tour showcased how Eilish has stepped into her status as an international superstar — an echelon she continued to climb even as the pandemic marred the release of 2021's \u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003eHappier Than Ever\u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003e. She kept very busy in the interim of the COVID-plagued industry, releasing live concert films taped at The Hollywood Bowl, sharing a documentary detailing her previous touring cycle, doing collaborations with Nike, branding new fragrances, and recording an Oscar-winning entry into the legacy of James Bond themes: \"No Time To Die.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThen the restrictions cleared, gatherings were permitted, and postponed dates were solidified, and so she hit the road, playing over 75 shows in almost eight months across four continents (she’s visiting the fifth, South America, in 2023), and that number doesn’t include her headlining slots at festivals like Coachella 2022.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eAlthough Eilish performed at both weekends of Coachella 2022 — which, despite its location in Indio, is an L.A. festival for all intents and purposes —  her performance within city limits took her infamous energy to a new level. Built on a combination of the considerable experience she gained as a performer in 2022 and her unfettered love for her hometown, Eilish truly seemed happier than ever onstage. Read on for five moments Billie Eilish showed Los Angeles that there is no place home.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n## \u003cspan\u003eBillie Gets Jazzy With Tunes New And Old\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eBillie Eilish is an artist born into a generation that doesn’t give a darn about genres. With Spotify and other DSPs, everyone has access to every genre in the palm of their hand, and she’s been influenced by all of them — including jazz.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eWhile her music may not fit a jazz aesthetic, Eilish has begun to implement more artistic improvisation into her vocal delivery. A lilt to close a phrase here; a small riff between verses there. The improvisation demonstrates her continued ownership over the songs, and Eilish's ease with manipulating them.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eSuch skills came front and center during two songs in particular: \"my future\" (her first time performing it on this tour) and \"Billie Bossa Nova.\" Had there not been thousands of fans screaming every word, Billie’s intricate vocal work could have turned the forum into an intimate jazz lounge for a few minutes.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n## \u003cspan\u003eListened To Her Fans, And Went Deep Into Her Catalog\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eIn the days leading up to the shows, Billie took to Instagram to ask fans what songs she should perform, because \"these shows are for you!\" \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eOn Dec. 13, Eilish performed \"xanny,\" the second track on \u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003eWHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO?\u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003e and one she hadn't performed in four years. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThere’s no way to know whether she decided to perform \"xanny\" because her fans requested it, though it was one of the most unifying moments in the entire show. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eIf only she had also done \"wish you were gay,\" which is what I sent to her through Instagram.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n## She Climbed \"Mount Everest\" With Some Friends\n\n\u003cspan\u003eWhen Billie says she has a song stuck in her head, everyone in the crowd knows she’s going to sing it. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eSo when she referenced Labrinth's \"\u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eMount Everest\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwrYDTHKxiE)\u003cspan\u003e,\" everyone knew what was coming — yes, that includes Labrinth’s appearance.

But she did so with aplomb, especially when she took on the duties for the verse of Labrinth’s song for the \"Euphoria\" soundtrack, \"I’ve Never Felt So Alone.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eFor \"I’ve Never Felt So Alone,\" the crowd was singing along instead of screaming along.

At this admission, Billie started laughing with sheer glee. Then Finneas started laughing at her.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eIt may sound like innocuous stage banter, but it’s a kind of chemistry that’s infectious. It was a powerful, honest moment that highlighted the unique chemistry required to make this music.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eEveryone in the crowd felt it, and the acoustic versions of  \"i love you,\" \"Your Power\" and \"TV,\" were just as powerful and honest.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n## \u003cspan\u003eSanta Eilish Or Billie Clause?\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eBillie Eilish was full of holiday cheer, giving not just the gift of music but actual gifts for the audience as well.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eFrom atop a raised platform that moved throughout the arena, where she performed three songs, Eilish took candy from a stocking and threw it into the crowd.

The singer also won Best Pop Vocal Album. Then 18 years old, she was the youngest-ever winner for all categories in the Big Four.

Ultimately, it's the launching pad for\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eHappier Than Ever\u003c/em\u003e. Here, in all her newly blonde glory (as seen on the Old Hollywood-inspired artwork), Eilish emerges from the cloudiness that engulfed\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003ewhile navigating the trauma she's experienced since the album's release.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHappier Than Ever\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003efeels like a heavy sigh, with Eilish sounding completely overwhelmed on nearly every song.

With the release of a philharmonic-backed concert film (the Disney+ special *Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter To Los Angeles*, nominated for Best Music Film) and multiple aesthetically pleasing live performances, Eilish displays a transformation at work — one helmed by an artist set on having full creative control."}},{"_meta":{"name":"Video Embed Player - Billie Eilish Happier Than Ever","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/video-embed-player","deliveryId":"d348271c-8236-4411-8c5f-32b947c96f97"},"videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GJWxDKyk3A"},{"_meta":{"name":"Body Text 3 - Billie Eilish visual artist","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/body-text","deliveryId":"5cc8299c-13e9-4a0e-9e2d-3f4cb154daae"},"bodyText":{"richText":"As that fateful scene in *The World's A Little Blurry* indicates, the documentary's director R.J. Cutler saw the genius within Eilish as they worked together. \"It was important to me to illustrate the fact that in terms of all other aspects of her work, her career, her business, her art and her image — whatever it might be, she is the final word,\" Cutler tells GRAMMY.com. \"It should be no surprise to anybody that a brilliant visionary director who has an incredible instinct and a very specific visual sensibility is in command of the camera.\"\n\nThat sense of visual awareness is integral to pop stardom — particularly for women artists, who have historically been held to a higher standard than their male counterparts. Knowing this, Eilish launched the *Happier Than Ever* era with an aesthetic rebranding that swapped her trademark neon green roots for an Old Hollywood-style blonde cut. \"I couldn't go anywhere with that hair because it was so obviously me,\" she told ***[Elle](https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a37598890/billie-eilish-is-calling-the-shots/)*** last year. \"I wanted anonymity.\"\n\nHer compromised sense of security is a major theme across *Happier Than Ever* — and rightfully so, considering she came of age in the public eye. Though Eilish had never fully lost authority of her narrative, building a world around such a personal record offered an opportunity to regain control in more ways than one.\n\n## Visualizing *Happier Than Ever*\n\nEilish's self-directed visual world began to truly take shape with the music video for \"**[Your Power](https://youtu.be/fzeWc3zh01g)**,\" a damning examination of abuse and its consequences — or lack thereof. Nearly camouflaged against the earthy tones of Simi Valley's mountainside, the singer steeps in her lyrical vulnerability while a green anaconda envelops her body. \"Your Power\" served as the follow up to \"**[Therefore I Am](https://youtu.be/RUQl6YcMalg)**,\" a final send-off to Eilish's old signature green-rooted hair.\n\nWithin her own visual direction, Eilish often errs on the side of solitude. She builds narratives through the use of distinct locations and dramatic accessories, rather than acting out elaborate scenes with other people — whether she's having a real tarantula crawl out of her mouth for early career cut \"**[You Should See Me In A Crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah0Ys50CqO8)**,\" walking down the middle of a street in the path of cars racing in all directions for \"**[NDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OORBa32WFcM)**,\" or performing in a torrential flood for \"Happier Than Ever.\"\n\nIn the official \"**[Male Fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_BhUxx-cwk)**\" music video, which Eilish directed *and* edited, she conveys cold and brooding emotions with acute power within isolation. She moves from the quiet space of a living room back to her bed, then in and out of the refrigerator before once again returning to the security of the blankets. It's the exact opposite parallel to the lively slumber party she directed for \"Lost Cause,\" which played into the same neutral color palette, but did so with a carefree air of spontaneity."}},{"_meta":{"name":"Video Embed Player - Billie Eilish Lost Cause","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/video-embed-player","deliveryId":"d9e93008-fc7d-4826-b9ce-b5302dcd6299"},"videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2dRcipMCpw"},{"_meta":{"name":"Body Text 4 - Billie Eilish visual artist","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/body-text","deliveryId":"03e4f4e6-9191-40d7-8a05-7d50edbfb914"},"bodyText":{"richText":"## Crafting Intimate Live Performances\n\nIn July 2021, Eilish kicked off a four-part live performance video series that saw the singer scale back the avant-garde ideas often executed in her music videos for a more intimate setting. For the first release in the series, she leaves behind the slithering snake of \"Your Power\" and reimagines the song at Los Angeles' Biltmore Hotel.\n\nOpening with an Old Hollywood film title card, the video places Eilish and Finneas against graceful orange curtains at the end of a long corridor at the hotel. The famed designs of the location are obscured with focus locked on the acoustic performance itself, a subtle visual narrative that develops over the course of the series. The historic 1930s hotel plays into the presence of Los Angeles as a character in Eilish's world, somewhere she often champions and revisits through song and video. Her constant call-backs add weight to the depth of the pivotal moment in \"Happier Than Ever\" where she cries out: \"I'd never treat me this shitty, you made me hate this city.\"\n\n\"We had a good, long conversation with their team early on about \\[wanting\\] to create this as Billie not only enters this new phase of her musical career, but as she becomes an adult starting to tackle bigger themes — as you can clearly hear on the album,\" says Micah Bickham, executive producer of content production at Vevo. \"We wanted to create this world that was elevated and took it to that same sort of place, exploring these more iconic and maybe more adult themes.\""}},{"_meta":{"name":"Video Embed Player - Billie Eilish Male Fantasy performance","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/video-embed-player","deliveryId":"d91f0b93-cb1e-47b5-9726-b6e42570ae0e"},"videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7YvaaAkRCw"},{"_meta":{"name":"Body Text 5 - Billie Eilish visual artist","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/body-text","deliveryId":"f00c0763-9e5e-4cf2-9d28-00d37c44ca6d"},"bodyText":{"richText":"For \"Male Fantasy,\" Eilish settles on the edge of a gold-blanketed bed in a torn cream sweater as she ruminates on the same notions of the male gaze and desire that she later explores in *A Love Letter to Los Angeles*. \"All of that was by design,\" Bickham explains. \"Her and Finneas in a simple hotel room just having a conversation with her fans in a way that blaring concert lights and large bands \\[couldn't\\].\"\n\nHe adds: \"We were just trying to create a bit of a paradox, if you will, between these softer environments and then take Billie into those worlds, who is basically, either vocally or performatively, creating a bit of a contrast. If you think about some of the songs, some of the lyrics juxtaposed to the world that she's sitting in, it's a really interesting simple expression of contrast. That was a really important part of it.\"\n\n## Completing Another Visual Journey\n\nIn the Vevo live performance series videos, there's a sense of emotional release that mirrors the intensity embedded within the lyrics. But *Happier Than Ever* is shaped through Old Hollywood regality, which displays the power of performance even in the absence of theatrics. \"**[Lost Cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuhYSH36aSM)**\" and the simmering, rhythmic \"Billie Bossa Nova\" are delivered in the Biltmore Hotel's famed Crystal Ballroom, using the location as a point of entry to the alluring tone of each track. As the final installation of the video series, \"Billie Bossa Nova\" places Eilish in the center of the ballroom in front of a trio of luxurious ceiling-high windows.\n\n\"It's like, how do we create vignettes and spaces for each of these conversations to take place so that when you watch them individually, they stand on their own two legs — but if you were to watch them as a collection, you see the evolution of those performances from song to song,\" Bickham says.\n\nThe series is a significant example of Eilish driving the narrative of *Happier Than Ever* forward through the use of hyper-specific tones and color palettes. The singer, who has synesthesia, established the visual and tonal range executed through wardrobe choices and set designs. The muted pinks, pops of blue, and array of neutral selections — juxtaposed to the gold regality of the hotel — correspond with the Eilish's own synesthetic perceptions of each song.\n\n\"There are not that many artists who create a world around the album that they're making. They're not just performing singles, they're creating a character and that character is operating inside a world and the visuals that you're seeing are built inside that world,\" Bickham says. \"Some people think they want endless possibilities, but it's important to have someone like Billie define what the parameters are and give us that thing that we can color inside the lines of, and help extend and build that world.\""}},{"_meta":{"name":"Video Embed Player Billie Eilish Billie Bossa Nova performance","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/video-embed-player","deliveryId":"5d28ac7e-f7bb-4671-8e77-5352d8121e7f"},"videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6mnfec7bTc"},{"_meta":{"name":"Body Text 6 - Billie Eilish visual artist","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/body-text","deliveryId":"90b03739-a1b5-4dcc-878a-73a49bb8d412"},"bodyText":{"richText":"## Reimagining The Concert Film\n\nAmid the rollout of Vevo performances, *Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter To Los Angeles* arrived in September. The hour-long special brought more stunning live performances, doubling as a tribute to Eilish's hometown. Filmed over a week at the Hollywood Bowl, Love Letter reconfigures the typical concert film formula — particularly thanks to her 2D animated avatar, which threads a visual storyline through the streets of California.\n\nWhen Eilish first approached animator Patrick Osborne and filmmaker Robert Rodriguez to co-direct the Disney+ feature, she — in very Billie fashion — had a specific vision for how the film would look.\n\n\"The first interaction we had, she was sending all of these reference images of blonde animated characters from '80s cartoons,\" Obsorne explains, recalling Ralph Bakshi and Jessica Rabbit-esque sources of inspiration. \"Billie, from the beginning, \\[wanted to have\\] an animated alter-ego version of herself that was kind of idealized and something she isn't.\"\n\nWorking under a tight deadline, animators in London, Los Angeles and Sydney created a landscape for the blonde avatar to explore Eilish's hometown.

She drives through rare traffic-less streets in a top-down convertible, making pit stops to take in the city from the rooftop of the Roosevelt Hotel and to dine alone at a quaint restaurant. Later, she arrives at a movie premiere under the shine of flashing lights. The avatar detours through Echo Park and Highland Park (the singer's longtime home until stalkers and security breaches made relocation imperative) before arriving at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\n\"If I was to dig into the psychology of the animated character, these '80s animated characters that she's referencing are really idealized from a male perspective,\" Osborne says, calling back to Eilish championing bodily autonomy and desire on *Happier Than Ever* itself.\n\n\"She has such a cool aesthetic eye that certain things feel like her,\" he adds. \"She had an angle on this and that, then it was up to me and Robert to shape it into some kind of achievable story.\"\n\n## Capturing A Precious Moment In Time\n\nThe unrestricted adventures of Eilish's 2D avatar are a call back to life before *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* and the massive influx of notoriety that followed. Having captured that moment in *The World's A Little Blurry*, R.J. Cutler recalls a recent conversation with Eilish's mother, Maggie Baird, about the change.\n\n\"Maggie said to me recently that she didn't expect that this would be one of the reasons she is so grateful for the film,\" he says. \"But she now recognizes that it captured a moment in their lives that in some instances no longer exists.\""}},{"_meta":{"name":"Video Embed Player - Billie Eilish Happier Than Ever performance","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/video-embed-player","deliveryId":"622e4abd-5675-4204-ab55-5c2690ee00fd"},"videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rn7bwD8qQ"},{"_meta":{"name":"Body Text 8 - Billie Eilish visual artist","schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/body-text","deliveryId":"ec17afe2-28a7-4152-af0d-efebc3e6dfb0"},"bodyText":{"richText":"At the pinnacle moment in *A Love Letter to Los Angeles*, the 2D character appears as the venue's sole audience. She watches the real Eilish perform an exceptional record of their shared experiences, backed by Finneas, the Los Angeles Children's Chorus, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, guitarist Romero Lubambo and drummer Andrew Marshall. The artist's ongoing theme of solitude, and the autonomy found within that, reaches a pointed height and speaks to the one consistency between where Eilish has been and where she's headed: herself.\n\n\"These films are a dialogue between the moment that they capture, and the moment that they're viewed,\" Cutler adds, noting the comparison between the 16-year-old girl in the Apple TV+ documentary and the now 20-year-old GRAMMY-winning musician currently embarking on a sold-out international arena tour.\n\nBy presenting the complex emotions of change in a tangible form, Eilish has constructed a living gallery of artistic growth. Surely she'll continue to evolve, but her *Happier Than Ever* era will always serve as an important statement piece of where she's been and where she's going — with her  artistic identity at its center.\n\n**[Smooth Like \"Butter\": How BTS' GRAMMY-Nominated Mega Hit Came To Be](https://www.grammy.com/news/behind-the-scenes-bts-butter-creation-rob-grimaldi-grammy-nominated-hit-song)**"}}],"tags":["Billie Eilish","2022 GRAMMYs","64th GRAMMY Awards","GRAMMYs"],"grammySeries":["GRAMMY Awards"],"contentGenre":["Pop"],"hero":{"_meta":{"name":"Photo - Billie Eilish Visual Artist Graphic","schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"id":"8258c6d9-98b4-4234-8442-85013aab2d55","contentType":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/photo"},"contributors":[{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/contributor","id":"b2adc094-c127-4de3-97d6-815998e4d517"}],"title":"Inside The Visual World Of Billie Eilish's 'Happier Than Ever,' A Testament To Her \"Brilliant\" Creative Vision","ampliencePublishedDate":1648685496425,"shortTitle":"Billie Eilish's Visual Road To 'Happier Than Ever'","primaryPillar":"GRAMMYs","subHeadline":"After years of longing to take creative control, Billie Eilish is finally at the helm of her visual output.

Raised by actor-musician parents, FINNEAS was immersed in the industry from a young age. Though his interest in songwriting was prompted by a class he took with his mom at age 12, he suggests that his production skills came naturally. From the beginning, his mantra has been simple: \"There's no right or wrong way to produce a song,\" he asserts. \"If there's any reason for people to pay attention, it's for being yourself and sharing your unique viewpoint.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eAs he honed his perspective, FINNEAS served as the lead singer and songwriter for his high school alt-rock band, the Slightlys. And while he jokes that they \"begged people to come listen to us,\" the group offered FINNEAS his first taste of success: Along with winning several local Battle of the Bands competitions, they even earned a performance slot at Warped Tour in 2015. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThe most fortuitous thing about the Slightlys, though, ended up being a song they never released — but FINNEAS' then-unknown sister Billie did. After he penned a minimalist pop song called \"Ocean Eyes\" for the band, he decided it would be a better fit for Billie's voice. Little did either of them know, it would be the beginning of a fruitful — and wildly successful — partnership.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThe song instantly gained traction on SoundCloud, prompting FINNEAS to start using his songwriting and production power to fuel Eilish's career.

His debut single, the lustful \"New Girl,\" features bluesy instrumentals and seductive vocals; 2017's \"I'm In Love Without You\" offered a more electro-pop-infused sound. As he continued to find his own musical identity, it quickly became clear that his early music would lean into the more bare-bones side of his creativity: breathy vocals, lush strings and rich piano chords.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThe next year proved to be pivotal for FINNEAS, both as Eilish's collaborator and as an artist in his own right.

I was singing this stuff forever — I mean, it seemed like forever, but I was 17 years old when my first independent record came out.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eI was so stoic about who I was, and the music that I loved. And I loved jazz, and I loved the Great American Songbook. I was so entrenched in loving that, and so protective of it. But it's funny, because it was literally so far from being cool or marketable that it took me so long to even get a meeting with a record company.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eEvery single label and agency said the same thing. And sometimes I'd wondered if they had talked to each other about it, and that there was, like, a manifesto that they had written, so that when Michael Bublé comes in to try to sell himself, here's what you say: \"You are a really talented young guy. You're really fun to watch on stage in the nightclubs, but this music, there's no commercial value in it, and we don't see how investing in you would be financially responsible. But, you're really talented, and it's going to happen for you one day.\" \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eFinally, when I was 25, I was introduced to \u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eDavid Foster\u003c/span\u003e](https://grammy.com/artists/david-foster/2127)\u003cspan\u003e, who at that time, was running 143/Reprise \\[Records\\] at Warner.

So I said to him, \"Would you take me to see Tom Whalley at Warner?\" And he said, \"No way. You're on my radar, but I just don't see how this kind of music is going to take off\" — the same thing!\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eI drove him nuts. Actually, as a matter of fact, it came down to him saying, \"The only way I'd produce a record is if you came up with the money,\" which was like, 100 grand a track. So my manager and I went bank to bank in Vancouver until we found someone who would lend us the money. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eI put David in an awkward position where he finally took me to Warner, and I got my deal. And even then, it was just the beginning of a long story, because I had a one-record deal, and they said, \"If you don't \\[sell\\] this many albums, there's no way there's a second album.\"\u003c/span\u003e"}},{"_meta":{"schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/video-embed-player","name":"Video Embed Player - Michael Buble Feeling Good","deliveryId":"d82cde66-e8ec-41b4-aa44-8088f138cb21"},"videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edwsf-8F3sI"},{"_meta":{"schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/body-text","name":"Body Text 3 - Michael Buble interview","deliveryId":"5f3bd1a7-68c7-4539-8dcf-0d14bbb68d54"},"bodyText":{"richText":"\u003cspan\u003eI had a great manager named Bruce Allen.

There was a concurrent community of younger artists and musicians, and they got tagged with the genre of being no wave. And no wave wasn't something that came out of punk or new wave. It actually coexisted as even more challenging music. Punk really was a rock and roll music, whereas no wave was absolutely not a rock and roll music. It was just using the instrumentation of it, but the players were approaching the instruments without any semblance of traditional tropes. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThat fascinated a lot of people who were already in New York City, downtown, in the art scene coming out of minimalist and conceptual art practices. Some of these artists are filmmakers, and they're very attracted to these bands that are creating a new way of playing music in complete resistance to the standards of expectation with traditionalism. No wave becomes a real pride of definition for them in some of the visual art. Super 8 and 16 millimeter movie cameras were affordable cameras. The film was somewhat affordable from certain film labs downtown. And you could make either silent, or if you're really audacious, sound movies that weren’t expensive. It wasn't any more expensive than making a 7-inch. And so these no wave filmmakers had a space on St. Mark's Place, just a ratty little storefront where they would show these movies. Some were better than others, let's put it that way, but the idea was that they were doing it and it was being done fast and it was using just the local people on the scene as actors. And some of them became serious filmmakers. I mean, Jim Jarmusch came out of that scene. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eJamie Nares was living in Manhattan and making these interesting films at the time, utilizing some of the no wave musicians as actors and actresses. Her films had a certain character about them because she had a really specific focus on what she wanted to present. It wasn't just having fun and slapdash. Some of the films were really affecting and really interesting. Also, if you look at the back of \u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003eNo New York\u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003e, the compilation album that \u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eBrian Eno\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.grammy.com/artists/brian-eno/2146)\u003cspan\u003e recorded of some of the bands on the downtown scene at that point, Jamie was the first guitar player in the Contortions. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eWhat was it about Nare's work specifically that really burrowed into you and led to this cover?\u003c/span\u003e**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eWell, the work actually on the cover of the record is maybe not that indicative of what people usually know about Jamie Nares today. A lot of her work is really in the realm of painting, fairly large canvases with huge swaths of energy, paint streaking across them. They're very dancey and poetic. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eI went to her retrospective \\[in Milwaukee\\], and noticed that some of her earlier sculptures were there, and one of them was that helmet with the tuning forks sticking out of it. I just thought it was so evocative and beautiful, this idea of taking a military implement and recontextualizing it as an article of communication and music. Jamie’s piece is called \"Samurai Walkman,\" and I toyed with calling the album that. But I really liked calling the record \u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003eFlow Critical Lucidity\u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003e, taken from a lyric Eva \\[Prinz\\] had written. She wrote lyrics to five out of the seven songs on the record. The line reminded me of something that would come out of the pen of Mark E. Smith of the Fall. Even though that's the last thing I think Eva was considering. She writes under the pseudonym Radieux Radio, and always has, since \u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003eThe Best Day\u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003e record in 2014. It's been really wonderful because it's this other voice that I get to work with. It's a voice that's decidedly not a white male voice. It's a feminist voice. And I really embrace that because I think that really gives the music that much more strength.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eWhat do you appreciate most about Eva's purview as a writer and lyricist?\u003c/span\u003e**\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThere's a certain joy to the intellect of nature that she is able to put into words that I find really endearing and alluring and smart. I tend to be a little more thorny, maybe a little more…I don't know, no wave sassy. I'll add a little bit to what she does and vice versa. It's a really great collaboration. We collaborate mostly on publishing books. She was a senior book editor at Rizzoli, Abrams, and Taschen. So that to me is really enjoyable, publishing books and actually putting some records up by new bands. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eWhat else do you have on tap?\u003c/span\u003e**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eWell, this record of mine is on our label, Daydream Library \\[Series\\]. We put out a new record by Devon Ross, a young singer/songwriter from Los Angeles. She's an actress and a model, and she was in this limited TV series called \"Irma Vep\" that the filmmaker Olivier Assayas made for HBO with Alicia Vikander. I met her at screenings and she said she had music. People send me music all the time, and I'm usually like, \"Yeah, sure.\" There's not that much I'm that interested in facilitating. I used to put a lot of records out through the '80s and '90s, but when we moved to London, I cooled down on it. And then we saw this band called Big Joanie, which was these three Black English girls who have a really amazing political punk band. We put out their first two records, and now Devon Ross is the latest that we put out.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eEva listened to it first and said, \"It's really good.\" I listened to it and I agreed. We put an EP out, and it's become really buzzy. She has this great band, and it's really just noisy, sonic punk pop music. There's a couple of bands in Miami that we put records out by. There's a shoegaze Caribbean kind of band called the Sea Foam Walls I really like. And there's an all-girl band there called Las Nubes, which means the clouds \u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003een español\u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003e. They sing in Spanish and English, and they're very much part of the Miami punk scene that is primarily bilingual. We put out a record by the drummer of the Ex, the anarcho-punk band from Holland… we put out a CD of her sound healing music. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eWe put out whatever we want. We're just an indie label out of our London flat, and we make books whenever we get enough coin to do something. We've done a few memoirs, one by David Toop, an experimental musician here in London. We're doing another one with Maggie Nicols, who since the late '60s has been in the forefront of free improvisation music here in England. We keep ourselves busy, but we try not to stretch ourselves too thin at the same time.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eRight now, I just want to stay in one place and continue writing because I really enjoyed writing the memoir. And now I'm heads down, putting the finishing touches on a novel that I hope to get published, if somebody bites. It takes place in the early '80s in downtown New York City, just characters.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eI bet that in its own way there’s some memoir to that, too.\u003c/span\u003e**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eA little bit, yeah, a little bit. I certainly realized that I had to place it in an environment that I could be intimate with. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eWhen you’re back in New York City and walking around, is it recognizable at all to you from 50 years ago?\u003c/span\u003e**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eEspecially the deeper in the Lower East Side you go, there are certain walls or corners where you can flash back on the '70s, early '80s. The city was far dirtier then, a little more lawless. And in that respect, you never really felt that safe. But when you're young, it's like you're somewhat invincible anyway. So I don't really miss it at the age I am now. I'd rather be living underneath an olive tree somewhere in northern Italy than having to live on East Broadway or something. But it's also a matter of financial stability. If somebody offered me some fabulous place in Manhattan, or anywhere in New York City, free of charge, I might swoop on it.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eBut I like living in London. We really love it. There's no guns here really. That's a real plus. I'm just really waiting to see what the elections are going to be in November as far as how safe I feel the USA is because I have such anxiety about that. We're flying in the day before the election just to vote. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eI know you’ve shared that you’re dealing with a heart condition, too. Has that cleared to the point that you can travel?\u003c/span\u003e**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eAnother reason why I'll be coming in at the end of the year is because I still have to go under the knife a bit. But it's nothing critical. It's just an ablation thing. People have AFib \\[atrial fibrillation\\] and irregular heartbeats and stuff, and sometimes you have to go in there and put a stent in. It's an operation that's done all day every day. Its success rate is 99%. I have more of a chance of falling out the window tonight. It still means that I can't do too much else. So I'm not going to really be doing much touring. But like I said, I prefer actually writing. I want to get into writer mode more so than getting into a van and crisscrossing the planet and playing in beer halls. I've done that a lot. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eI'll play some specific shows as long as they are interesting. I like playing in special places like in churches, and certain festivals are cool. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**Can you talk about building the sound on *Flow Critical Lucidity*? There are parts of it that conjure [The Stooges](https://grammy.com/videos/iggy-pop-the-stooges-stage-performance-style-archival-footage-sound-bites)’ \"We Will Fall,\" or something like that.**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it does have that vibe. I demoed a lot of it on a small digital recorder that I figured out how to use because I'm pretty much a Luddite with this stuff. I allowed the musicians to create parts to what I was doing. I was using digital drum patterns just so I could have a drum pattern, and sometimes I would pick these really weirdo drum patterns. So something like the song \"We Get High\" has that \"We Will Fall\" drum rhythm. And my drummer, Jem Daulton, listened to that and he recreated it himself, or at least what that vibe was. We used a studio called Total Refreshment Centre in North London that the Chicago label International Anthem uses as their English studio. It has that kind of new cosmic dub vibe. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThen there’s Jon Leidecker, who's an electronics musician who's in the band, he's actually processing some of the inputs and outputting them in a specific way and adding some electronic flourishes. He records under the name Wobbly and is a member of Negativland. That, and also the engineer, Margo Broom, was really instrumental in how that record sounded. She had recorded, mixed, and mastered Big Joanie, and I really liked how those records were sounding. She's a genius, and she really made this record sound the way it sounds. Watching her work, she was just so smart and so expedient, and she really knew my history as a musician. Even working with the vocals, I always hate my vocals because I feel like I'm being very challenged by how to stay in key to all this finicky music. I was really impressed how she was treating the vocals and making it work. And she said, \"Well, I've been listening to your vocals since I was 10 years old.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eHow did you treat singing back in the '80s? Were you just not self-conscious about it? Because you sound comfortable on this.\u003c/span\u003e**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eIt was through fits and starts that I had some realization of how to present myself as a vocalist. I never felt like I reached a point where I feel like I am comfortable with it, and I regret not actually focusing on that more seriously as I did with everything else. When it came to getting on the mic, I just thought, well, it's either going to work or it's not. And then I realized, no, there's a lot of discipline. There's a lot of practice that you can put into this. When I see \u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eNick Cave\u003c/span\u003e](https://grammy.com/artists/nick-cave/187021)\u003cspan\u003e sit down at a piano and start singing, it’s clear this is somebody who's really focused on how to be a singer. I regret that I didn't focus more on that because I think there's such a power there. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eRead more:\u003c/span\u003e** [\u003cspan\u003eNick Cave Returns With The Bad Seeds To Plant Joyful Noise\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.grammy.com/news/nick-cave-interview-new-album-wild-god-bad-seeds-tour)\n\n\u003cspan\u003eWhen you would see punk bands in the late '80s, early '90s, it was like, \"Okay, the singers can be good, or they can be not so good, but the collective is what it's all about.\" But at the same time, a band like \u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eNirvana\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.grammy.com/artists/nirvana/8026)\u003cspan\u003e comes out, and they’re a great band, but they’re not altogether that different from a lot of other bands that they associated with. What's really raising the level is that singer's voice and how that singer is getting on the microphone. Kurt's voice was just something else entirely. Nobody was singing like that. When I first heard him, I was like, \"Oh, he's doing a Lemmy from \u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eMotörhead\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.grammy.com/artists/motorhead/14767)\u003cspan\u003e thing but in the context of a Pacific Northwest punk thing. That's brilliant.\" But it was so much more than that because it was soul shredding and it was beautiful. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eSo I always thought, in my case, I can be a serviceable singer more than a remarkable singer. There's only a few people who can be remarkable singers. It's like wanting to speak another language. I wish I could speak another language. I wish I could sing with the same astounding resonance as \u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eBillie Holiday\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.grammy.com/artists/billie-holiday/11866)\u003cspan\u003e or Joni Mitchell. But I ignored that. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eI'm very conscious of that when I make a record now. Like, \"I'm going to do my best here.\" But when I listen to live tapes, I'm just like, \"Man, nobody's going to get fooled into thinking that I'm Jim Morrison.\" I used to complain about Steve Albini's vocal mixes. It was all about really slamming drums and guitars and stuff like that. And I love Steve, but I was like, \"The vocals kind of suffer because everything else is just blasting.\" And his response was, \"Well, listen, most of these singers I record, very few of them are \u003c/span\u003e[\u003cspan\u003ePaul McCartneys\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.grammy.com/artists/paul-mccartney/4678)\u003cspan\u003e.\" And he's right about that. But also it's like, \"Well, maybe you should try to make them Paul McCartneys. Let's figure this out. Take some singing lessons.\" \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eRead more:\u003c/span\u003e** [\u003cspan\u003eWithout Steve Albini, These 5 Albums Would Be Unrecognizable: Pixies, Nirvana, PJ Harvey \u0026amp; More\u003c/span\u003e](https://www.grammy.com/news/remembering-steve-albini-engineer-nirvana-pixies-pj-harvey)\n\n\u003cspan\u003eBack in 1985 or '86, we were doing some gig and this musician came up to me and she goes, \"There’s nothing wrong with taking singing lessons. You should try singing and not screaming or shouting.\" I was really just in shock. I was like, \"Wow. I never even thought about that.\" Early on, I was just yelling into the microphone. Of course, there was a lot of din going on on stage. You had to yell to get heard because the sound systems couldn't deal with the blasting guitar noise. But it made me think, \"You're right, that would make it better.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eI assumed this would be a long answer so I saved it for the end, but what are you listening to and reading lately that’s turning you on?\u003c/span\u003e**\n\n\u003cspan\u003eI take cues from other young poets that I see in social media sharing what they're reading and then sending away for those books. I love that whole culture of literature. There's a lot of mainstream literature I think is great. I think Colson Whitehead continues to be one of the great writers that we have in the USA, if not the world. Even this trio of genre novels that he's been working on, that second one, \u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003eHarlem Shuffle,\u003c/span\u003e*\u003cspan\u003e was really, really fun to read and really extremely artful and for me, a great course in how to write fiction, just by reading a book like that.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eAnd listening, I know I just constantly take cues again from different people I entrust with their tastes of buying records on Bandcamp. I generally tend towards buying more experimental music, the whole continuing underground aesthetics that you might hear coming out of the Wolf Eyes world. I still think that's where some great music is happening. I don't really listen to too much straight ahead, compositional rock and roll music. I feel like I've so decoded a lot of that kind of songwriting that I don't find myself listening to it for any sense of wonder. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eSometimes I'll spend an hour or two just putting things on, playing them at a commanding volume, and I'll just sit there and look at the record cover. Sometimes it leads me into being really intrigued by other people on the record, and I'll go into Discogs and find out all the other work they've done. That's what I really adore about the internet. You can actually do this research while you're processing the work. The internet was always an ideal coming out of the hippie mindset anyway, wasn't it? It's just been corporatized and monetized beyond any recognition of such a thing. But it does exist.\u003c/span\u003e"}},{"_meta":{"schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/related-content-embed","name":"Alternative Related Content","deliveryId":"f57c2ac0-e16a-4c0b-8ad9-c306d91efe4d"},"searchType":{"AutoOrManual":"Manual","contentTypes":"News + Video"},"searchParameters":{"tags":["Alternative"],"contentGenre":"Alternative"},"title":"More Alternative Music News"}],"hero":{"id":"95e37972-a8fa-4209-8391-8cf25bfef1a0","_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference","name":"Living Legends: Thurston Moore On New Album 'Flow Critical Lucidity,' No Wave \u0026 His Place In Experimental Music History"},"contentType":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/photo"},"contentGenre":["Alternative"],"tags":["Thurston Moore","Eva Prinz","Sonic Youth","indie rock","punk","experimental","Nirvana","Joni Mitchell","Nick Cave","The Stooges","Alternative"],"hasGATrackingLink":true,"metadata":{"disableRobots":false,"_meta":{"schema":"https://therecordingacademy.com/content/meta-data"}},"isChatbotAvailable":false,"fbiaPublished":false,"ampliencePublishedDate":1726843469996,"source":"GRAMMYs","primaryPillar":"GRAMMYs","title":"Living Legends: Thurston Moore On New Album 'Flow Critical Lucidity,' No Wave \u0026 His Place In Experimental Music History","shortTitle":"Living Legends: Thurston Moore","subHeadline":"\"I tend to be a little more thorny, maybe a little more…I don't know, no wave sassy,\" Thurston Moore tells GRAMMY.com of his history as an indie rock songwriter. \"Right now, I just want to stay in one place and continue writing.\"","articleSummary":"\"I tend to be a little more thorny, maybe a little more…I don't know, no wave sassy,\" Thurston Moore tells GRAMMY.com of his history as an indie rock songwriter.

From there, they participate in the scholarship ceremony together. Every artist and scholarship recipient's relationship is different, but all of them have forged a special relationship, and the artist has provided them with mentorship or different access and opportunities. \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eFor example, Nicolle opened a concert for Carlos Vives. We have had scholarship recipients who participated in conversations through Learning Labs or our other programming who have been able to meet with the artist.

They learn social-emotional learning skills, how to work in a team and the perseverance and dedication involved in the study of music. Those are skills that are going to make you successful no matter what you do in life.                                                \u003c/span\u003e\n\n**\u003cspan\u003eCan you describe a pivotal moment or decision in the Foundation's history that significantly altered its trajectory or expanded its scope?\u003c/span\u003e**\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003eThe Foundation's growth has been steady and intentional.
